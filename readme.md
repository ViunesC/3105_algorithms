# 3105 Algorithms
This repository contains a collection of algorithms that were discussed in the course *CSI3105: Analysis of algorithm I* during Fall 2023. They are implemented using mainly C++.
For personal archive only

### How to run the code
For every algorithm, there is a piece of code for testing. I've comment-out all of them since it's designed to be mutually exclusive. Pick one you want and un-comment them, then compile and run main.cpp

### List of problems and algorithm (more to come):
1. Stable Matching - Gale shapley algorithm
2. Graph - breadth-first-search (BFS) and depth-first-search (DFS)
